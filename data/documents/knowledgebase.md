whose Aadhar shall I use for verification?                | Ah, I understand now!<br><br>It seems like you're unsure about whose Aadhaar you should use for verification. No worries, I'm here to clarify things for you! | When it comes to verifying your account, it's important to use your own Aadhaar for the verification process. Make sure to use the Aadhaar details that belong to you personally. Using someone else's Aadhaar for verification purposes is not recommended, as it may lead to issues down the line. 🌟🔐                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
My Aadhar is already used                                 | I see, it seems that the Aadhaar you're trying to use for verification is already linked to an existing FamX account. 😕                                      | It's possible that you might have previously used this Aadhaar to create an account or it's already associated with another account on FamX.<br><br>To proceed with the verification process, you'll need to use a different Aadhaar that hasn't been used or linked to any existing FamX account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Mobile number not linked to Aadhar                        | Ah, I understand now! It seems that your mobile number is not linked to your Aadhaar. 😕                                                                      | To verify your Aadhaar successfully, it's essential to have a mobile number linked to it. The verification process usually involves receiving an OTP (One-Time Password) on your registered mobile number for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
DigiLocker server down                                    | Oh, it looks like you're experiencing an issue because the DigiLocker server is down. 😔                                                                      | When the DigiLocker server is down, it can temporarily disrupt the services and functionalities related to DigiLocker, including the verification process. Unfortunately, this is something beyond our control, as server maintenance or technical glitches can occur from time to time.<br><br>I recommend trying the verification process again after some time. Usually, server issues are resolved relatively quickly, and you should be able to proceed with the verification once the server is up and running again.

Why do I need to provide device permissions? | Great question! 😊📱<br><br>When you're asked to provide device permissions during the verification process, it's to ensure that the necessary functionalities of your device, such as the camera, microphone and location, can be utilized for a successful verification experience. | Let me explain why these permissions are required:<br><br>1\. Camera permission: The camera permission allows the verification process to capture live video or images of your identity documents or yourself during the video call. It helps in verifying your identity and ensuring the authenticity of the information provided.<br>2\. Microphone permission: The microphone permission allows the verification process to capture audio during the video call. It enables communication between you and the verification agent, making it possible to interact, provide responses, and clarify any information if needed.<br>3\. Location permission: The location permission allows the verification process to access your device's GPS or network-based location information. This information can help verify your current location and ensure that you are present in the specified region or country where the verification is being conducted. It adds an extra layer of verification and helps prevent fraudulent activities.                                                                                                                 | These permissions are crucial to conduct a thorough and accurate verification process. They are requested to protect your identity and ensure the security of the verification procedure. Rest assured that the permissions are used solely for the purpose of verification and are not intended for any other unauthorized activities.
Why do I need to confirm my address ?        | Great question! 😊🏠<br><br>Confirming your address during the verification process serves a few important purposes.                                                                                                                                                                  | Let me explain why it's necessary:<br><br>1\. Identity verification: Confirming your address helps verify your identity and ensures that the information you provide matches the records available. It adds an extra layer of authentication, as your address is a crucial component of your identity.<br>2\. Compliance with regulations: Verifying your address is often required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. It helps ensure that the verification process meets the standards set by governing authorities and helps prevent fraudulent activities.<br>3\. Service eligibility: In certain cases, confirming your address may be necessary to determine your eligibility for specific services or to comply with location-based regulations. It helps validate that you are in a particular region or country where the service is available or allowed.<br>4\. Security and fraud prevention: Confirming your address helps protect your account and personal information from unauthorized access and fraudulent activities. It ensures that only the rightful owner of the account can proceed with the verification process. | By confirming your address, you contribute to a more secure and reliable verification process, safeguarding your personal information and preventing potential misuse.
